<h1>CP5638 -  Project Plan</h1>
<h2>Group Number 10</h2>
<p><strong>Members:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Anagani Naga Sai - JC498863</li>

        <li>Devalla Amara Naga Babu - JC520838</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The main goal of the webiste is to recruit new numbers and increase engagement of members in our activities, e.g. volunteering for adminstration organising and promoting concerts and workshops. The webiste also aims to increase ticket sales, especially to the general public. It also encourage performances to let us organise a concert for them and to cooperate with promotion, photo shoots, media releases, etc.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> The registration form in the website helps to calculate the number of users registered.It will also increase the interactions of members in our activities like organising the concerts and workshops, etc.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>We "specialise in diversity" i.e. we provide performance opportunities for a very wide range of styles and genres which would otherwise have little exposure, therefore our target audience includes a wide range of ages and tastes. The typical audience may include people with specialised tastes, e.g. classical, jazz, ethnic music, etc. If children are involved, then parents and family members predominate. Every concert, therefore, needs a distinctive theme.
</p>
